title: Senior UI/interactive Developer, Intentional Futures
time: Jan 2015 - current
description: As the sole fulltime developer at iF I spend my days collaborating with a team of awesome designers, interfacing with clients, and strategizing with our producers. I develop and maintain www.intentionalfutures.com and take part in the development process of a variety of exciting projects - for clients ranging from startup ventures, to non-profits, to a fortune 500 company. My time at iF has been one of lateral growth, exposing me to new ways of collaborating and thinking - including expanding my role as a strategist and UX thinker.

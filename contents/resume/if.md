title: Senior UI/interactive Developer, Intentional Futures
time: Jan 2015 - current
description: As the sole fulltime developer at iF I spend my days collaborating with a team of awesome designers, interfacing with clients, and strategizing with our producers. I have been lucky to develop the wonderful www.intentionalfutures.com and be part the development process of a variety of exciting client projects, including a few startup ventures as well as a fortune 500 company. My time at iF has been one of lateral growth, exposing me to new ways of collaborating and thinking - including expanding my role as a strategist and UX thinker.

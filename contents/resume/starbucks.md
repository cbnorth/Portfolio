title: UI Developer at Starbucks Headquarters
time: Feb 2014 - Sept 2014
description: I was part of a small team within the front-end development practice at Starbucks dedicated to trying to improve UI development practices and bringing together team members to work more collaboratively. I also had ownership of the redevelopment of the Starbucks style guide that was formed from the disparate parts of the design patterns all over the site, both new and old. The result was a modernly coded pattern library, which was integrated into every aspect of the code base.

title: UI Developer at Starbucks Headquarters
time: Feb 2014 - Sept 2014
description: At Starbucks I was part of a small, UI focused, design and dev team who were dedicated to trying to improve UI development practices in the vein of learning to work more collaboratively. I also had ownership of the redevelopment of the Starbucks style guide that was formed from the disparate parts of the design patterns all over the site, both new and old. The result was a modernly coded pattern library, which was integrated into every aspect of the code base.

      p As a Developer I pride myself on my ability to collaborate and strategize with my coworkers. I love pixel pushing with designers, researching with UX architects, and pushing the boundaries of what it means to deliver to a product with my fellow developers. Over the last several years I've learned through osmosis and dedicated skill building the basics of UX architecture, typography and visual design. I'm at my best when I'm working on set tasks and working towards a goal &mdash; with an empowered team. I am passionate about what I do and love fostering my skills and building towards my next adventure.

      p I'm in the process of transition from into a new role at <a href="http://www.thomasstreet.com" target="_blank">Thomas Street</a>.

      //- , where I've been honing my skills laterally &mdash; learning to research, strategize, communicate with clients and run small teams of developers. 

      p Outside of work you'll likely hear about insatiable thirst for travel, my adventures in home renovation, and my love of jumping photos, food, and craft cocktails. 

      p Iâ€™d love to connect with you! Send me a <a href="/contact">message</a> or find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uidevchrisburke" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
